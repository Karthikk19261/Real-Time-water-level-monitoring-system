Drawbacks from existing system



•	The existing system involves a Central Monitoring Office which itself might be affected due to the flood/rain which might cause the entire network to fail.
•	Therefore there is the necessity for a more distributed ad-hoc network.

•	In our system,each subscribed node transmits the water level measured using the sensor using a RF wireless radio transceiver to other nodes in its vicinity.
•	Each node itself is used to send alerts to all users within its vicinity(if water level is greater than threshold value) rather than a central monitoring office.
•	This ensures continuity in the network even if a few nodes are affected due to flood or rain.

•	The absence of a central monitoring system makes storage and further processing on water level data difficult; however , even this can be overcome if we use a hybrid network with a central storage node.
