# Real-Time-water-level-monitoring-system

In the past few years the rainfall in India has deviated from the normal pattern.It has become difficult to predict which region will face floods and which region will face droughts.Knowing the exact volume of water in river bodies can help trigger flood alerts in a much faster and efficient way.Similarly real time water monitoring can help in calculated and efficient usage of water in case of droughts. We will be focusing on is increasing the range of network which would benefit from our project.We hope that this project provides most accurate prediction of the natural disaster beforehand to take precautionary measures accordingly.Achieving an automated dam is a part of our project including drought detection and we aim to perfect both the predictions.We also hope this project could be accessible and reliable for all the consumers.

Drawbacks from existing system



•	The existing system involves a Central Monitoring Office which itself might be affected due to the flood/rain which might cause the entire network to fail.
•	Therefore there is the necessity for a more distributed ad-hoc network.

•	In our system,each subscribed node transmits the water level measured using the sensor using a RF wireless radio transceiver to other nodes in its vicinity.
•	Each node itself is used to send alerts to all users within its vicinity(if water level is greater than threshold value) rather than a central monitoring office.
•	This ensures continuity in the network even if a few nodes are affected due to flood or rain.

•	The absence of a central monitoring system makes storage and further processing on water level data difficult; however , even this can be overcome if we use a hybrid network with a central storage node.
